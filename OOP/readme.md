# C++ Basic Programs

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of simple C++ programs that cover fundamental concepts such as input/output, variables, operators, conditional statements, loops, and functions.

## List of Programs

### 1. Hello World
A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

### 2. Variables and Data Types
Demonstrates the use of different data types such as `int`, `double`, `char`, and `string`.

### 3. User Input
Takes user input for name and age and prints a greeting message.

### 4. Arithmetic Operations
Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

### 5. Simple If Statement
Checks if a person is an adult (age 18 or above) and prints a message.

### 6. If-Else Statement
Checks if a person is an adult (age 18 or above) or a minor and prints the respective message.

### 7. If-Else Ladder
Determines if a person is a minor, an adult, or a senior citizen based on their age.

### 8. For Loop
Demonstrates the use of a `for` loop to iterate and print messages.

### 9. While Loop
Uses a `while` loop to perform iterations and print messages.

### 10. Function with Parameters
Defines a function to add two numbers and returns the result.

### 11. Another Function Example
A variation of the function that adds two numbers with different inputs.

### 12. Function with String Parameter
Defines a function that takes a name as input and prints a greeting.

### 13. Check Even or Odd
Takes a number as input and determines if it is even or odd.

## How to Run
1. Install a C++ compiler (e.g., g++ for GCC).
2. Copy any of the programs into a file with a `.cpp` extension.
3. Compile the program using the command:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./output
   ```
